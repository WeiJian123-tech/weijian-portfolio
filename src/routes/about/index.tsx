                            I'm a web developer and programmer who has studied various programming languages like React.js and Java. 
                            I usually create open source GitHub projects on my own free time prioritizing user interface experience and quirky ideas. üòä

                            During my free time, I like to play video games like <Redirlink 
                            pathName={"https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/us/en/"}

                            I like to play video games so much that I wanted to make a video game myself.

                            Therefore during my middle school years,
                            I decided with my stary-eyed passion to start learning how to program from <Redirlink pathName={"https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming"} label={"Khan Academy"} />. ü§©
                            Programming was intuitive because I just had to figure out which steps to place in order for ther program to work.
                            Yet programming was boring and convoluted since I had to determine exactly <i>how</i> it should be ordered along with syntax, bugs, etc. üëæ
                        </p>
                        <p class="py-2 text-2xl font-serif font-normal indent-8">
                            You would think a program would be able to run even without a missing semicolon, huh? üôÑ
                            Wait what? How was I supposed to know I would inevitably create an infinite loop in my JavaScript program!? üòñ
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Oh... Missing ending condition. üòë üòê
                        </p>
                        <p class="py-2 text-2xl font-serif font-normal indent-8">
                            Anyways, overtime I researched and failed faster to improve my programming skills and attain greater knowledge of computer science as a whole.
                            Every glitch/bug was an utter annoyance and an oppurtunity to learn how to fix it. 
                            Every all-nighter was tiresome and built character along the way.
                            And all the people I met and worked with helped guide my path along my ever continuous programming and professional development. üíØ
                            When the problems got difficult, I asked my teachers/professors for help or surfed the web for any solutions.

                            Programs are meant to be solutions to problem(s).

                            I have an undergraduate computer science degree from CUNY Brooklyn College. 
                            I learned about data structures, discrete structures, C++ programming paradigms, and more.
                            I attended a competitive web development fellowship called CUNY Tech Prep. 
                            I volunteered and interned at organizations like New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG)
                            where I participated in planning and holding events for activism related topics/goals.
                            Even after attaining my degree and working at a few organizations, I continue to learn and grow.
                            I program and push my projects onto GitHub for the world to see. To view them, please visit
